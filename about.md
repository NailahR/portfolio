## ABOUT NAILAH

Hello, my name is Nailah Reaves. I am a young, innovative, and ambitious black woman, who intends to infiltrate the power behind the scenes of the music industry. Executive leadership, management and technological innovation remains dominated by white males with too few women in positions of power. I intend to break down this barrier and help fill the void of women, specifically women of color, who will be a significant force shaping the industry's evolution and growth. My goal is to create beautiful art while inspiring and uplifting others like myself, who have been made to feel like their dreams are unreasonable or impossible.
